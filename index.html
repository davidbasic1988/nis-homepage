                    Right on the Nišava River is the daunting Ottoman fort that was completed in 1723. This encloses an ancient citadel and has been settled since a Roman camp was founded here more than 2,000 years ago. Tours duration is in 1 hour.

                <h4>Visit the Bubanj memorial site</h4>
                <p>
                    During the Second World War, a mass execution took place on Mount Bubanj. 10,000 prisoners from Crveni Krst camp were killed on this hilltop. Yugoslav artist Ivan Sabolić created the monument that depicts three clenched fists to symbolise the defiance of the children, women, and men who died here.

                    Kazandžijsko sokače quarter is situated in Niš at Kopitareva streets and represents one of the oldest remaining parts of Niš. At this very place, Turkish quarter "Sagr Cincar mahalla" was situated, according to urban plans of Niš from 1878. Turkish word “sagr” means “craftsman”, which means that during the Ottoman era, this place was a craftsmen quarter.
